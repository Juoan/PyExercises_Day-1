#Ex1:
num_one = 5
num_two = 4

#a) Add num_one and num_two and assign the value to a variable total
total = num_one + num_two
print(total)

#b) Subtract num_two from num_one and assign the value to a variable diff
diff = num_one - num_two
print(diff)

#c) Multiply num_two and num_one and assign the value to a variable product
product = num_one * num_two
print(product)

#d) Divide num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable division
division = num_one / num_two
print(division)

#e) Use modulus division to find num_two divided by num_one and assign the value to a variable remainder
remainder = num_two % num_one
print(remainder)

#f) Calculate num_one to the power of num_two and assign the value to a variable exp
exp = num_one ** num_two
print(exp)

#g) Find floor division of num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable floor_division
floor_division = num_one // num_two
print(floor_division)

#Ex2:
radius = 30

#a) Calculate the area of a circle and assign the value to a variable named area_of_circle
area_of_circle = 3.14 * radius ** 2
print(area_of_circle)

#b) Calculate the circumference of a circle and assign the value to a variable named circum_of_circle
circum_of_circle = 2 * 3.14 * radius
print(circum_of_circle)

#c) Take radius as user input and calculate the area.
radius = float(input("Enter the radius: "))
area_of_circle = 3.14 * radius ** 2
print(area_of_circle)
